Dealer2: Greetings, I am dealer2.
Dealer2: The game we are going to play is easy. 
Dealer2: I am going to shuffle a new deck "randomly", and you are going to guess what the card on top of the deck is.
Dealer2: You can put at least 30 Fins(no maximum) as stake before I reveal the card.
Dealer2: If you get it wrong, you lose all the Fins you put in and keep on guessing on that card.
Dealer2: If you get it right, you get your stake back and win an extra of half the number you put in.
Dealer2: Are you ready?
